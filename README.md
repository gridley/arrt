# ARRT
## Another Random Ray Tracer

This implements the random ray method for solving neutral particle transport problems.
In particular, it solves a 2D problem using a multiple polar angle quadrature.
Currently, only a single geometric input is supported, but adaptation to general
Cartesian mesh problems is trivial.
